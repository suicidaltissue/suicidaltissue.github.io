# The Scientific Method

## What is science?
Evidence gathering and proving problems with evidence.

There is a methodology to doing this, which has evolved overtime. In these two lectures we will cover the following scientific methods.
- Falsifiability
- Paradigm Shifts
- Types of reasoning
- Hypothetico-Deductive Model
- Hypothesis and null Hypothesis testing
- Comfirmation Bias

## Occams Razor
"All things being equal, the simplest solution tends to be the best one" 

if you hear hoof beats in a fforest think horses. not zebras, although there are zebra in the UK it requires a lot more assumptions to assume that the hoofbeats are the zebras, whereas the most obviouse and likely the correct explanation would be the horses.

## Falsifiability
**a theory** in the empirical sciences **can never be proven, but it can be falsified** this means that it should be scrutinised by decisive experiments. 

## Normal Science
Mostly puzzle solving within a conceptual framework
The build-up of results which fail to conform to the paradigm leads to a scientific crisis, resulting in paradigm shift

## Consilience of Inductions
Evidence from multiple independent, unrelated sources (when in agreement) can converge to form strong conclusions
Even when individually each source of evidence is not significant on its own.


## Reasoning
![[Pasted image 20240228125106.png]]

There are a number of methods that can be applied when reasoning.
### Deduction
Is a natural form of reasoning, you start with a premise that may or may not be true. another example in the context of programming may be something like
- All swans are white
- Daisy is a swan
- Therefore Daisy is white

### Abduction
The most simple and logical conclusion from a set of observations.
- All swans are white
- Daisy is white
- Therefore, daisy is a swan

### Induction
Drawing conclusions by going from the specific to the general
- Daisy is a swan and is white
- Danny is a swan and white
- Dante is a swan and white
- Therefore, all swans are white.

## Hypothetical deductive model

Lets imagine your about the start a PHP Program, your supervisor gives you a stack of papers to read and this will be your 
"Current State Of Knowledge" you can then 

## Objects and methods

## Hypothesis
- Proposed explanation for a phenomenon
- Prediction must be testable and falsifiable
- Repeatable
- Potentially explain further phenomena
- Adhere to Occam's Razor

## Null and Alternative Hypothesis
The null hypothesis is the statement that is assumed to be true at the beginning of our test/experiment
- H0: There is no difference between the new drug and existing drug on average.
- HA: Alternative hypothesis relates to the statement accepted if the null is rejected.
- H1: On average the new drug is more effective than the existing drug

### Outcomes of Hypothesis Testing

## Descriptive Science
Non-hypothesis Driven Science 
Observing, recording, describing, and classifying phenomena 
”All science is either physics or stamp collecting” — Ernest Rutherford
- Genome Sequencing inc. metagenomics
- Human Anatomy
- Taxonomy
## The Wason Card Problem
![[Pasted image 20240511152839.png]]
- Only considering evidence that supports existing beliefs
- if-then logical statements are not commutable
- Inverse error: if vowel then even, but not vowel does not imply not even
## Confirmation Bias
Data: 2,4,8
Rule: Numbers must be in ascending order
## Correlation vs Causation

## Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

### Positive and Negative Result

### Control Reactions

### Problems
![[Pasted image 20240511153238.png]]
## Scientific Controls
- Reduce noise between dependent and independent variable
- Positive control: Understand failed experiments
- Negative: Validates results
- Software testing (unit, development etc)
- A/B testing
”Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!” — Edsger Dijkstra
