# Some Types of Data
Some types of data you might collect and analyse while doing science:
- Binary (dichotomous) - 0.1
- Categorical - "walk", "drive", "cycle"
- Discrete - 1,2,3,4,5,6
- Ordinal - "bad", "good," "very good", "excellent"
- Continuous - 4.5, 8.6, 1000.3678
- Dates and times - "29/02/2024 14:10"
What Python datatypes could you use for these?
Which would you use NumPy for? Which would you use Pandas for?

# Some Types of Experiment
Often, scientific experiments are done to compare two or more options. Or to find out whether a change makes an improvement.

For example:
- Is a new drug effective at shortening the period of illness with Covid?
- Does crop yield increase if the seed is warmed before planting?
- Which of two proposed website designs improves sales? 
- Which walking aids do stroke patients feel more comfortable using?

What data might we collect and analyse for each of these?
What might we use as positive and/or negative controls, if relevant?
