# Randomness

## In Scientific Experiments
You can use randomness when setting up scientific experiments, for example.
### Randomised Controlled Clinic Trials
Can **look at** a new **treatment A** against **treatment B**

### Double Blind Trials
Neither researchers nor patients know what they are getting, a computer assigns a patient a random code number for a treatment group.

## Random Number Generators
There are a number of different ways to generate random numbers, we will look at the different Hardware and Software solutions available.
### Hardware
Is a device that generates random numbers from a physical process such as

- Thermal Noise in electronics
- Nuclear Decay
- Quantum Processes

There are a number of famous devices that do this for examples
- National Lottery Machine
- ERNIE
- Cloudflare Lavaland

### Software
#### Pseudo-random number generator
computer algorithm which generates a sequence of numbers  approximating the properties of sequences of random numbers.Completely deterministic, with periodic pattern like 1-4-3-2,1-4-3-2, 1-4-3-2, ... but usually much longer

we call it pseudo random because any number generated with a known algorithm is not truly random this means that depending on the input variables it will have a pattern that repeats.

##### [Linear Congruential Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator)
Is a type of [[#Pseudo-random number generator]] it works by using the following mathematical expression

```
((a * x) + c) % m
```

it takes 3 variables
- **M** Modulus
- **A** Multiplier
- **C** Increment

In python we can generate a sequence of "random" numbers
```python
x = 3
fort i in range(20):
	x = ((a*x)+c) % m
	print(x)
```

### Mersenne Twister Algorithm
Default random number generator in Python
Proposed by Makoto Matsumoto Keio and Takuji Nishimura
Period length is a Mersenne prime, default = 219937 âˆ’ 1
Major applications: simulation and modeling
Other RNGs exist with different properties, eg xor shift 10/25

## Python Modules
There are a number of different python modules available for generating random data. In this case we will look at
### Python Standard Library

```python
import random
for i in range(5):
    print(random.random())
```
this function takes 2 optional parameters `random.random(start, end)` which will go from start up until end so if end is 1 then it will generate a number between the 2

#### Uniform (Floats)
`random.uniform(a,b)`
Returns a random floating point number N such that a < N < b
in a uniform distribution every number can occur with equal probability

#### Integers
`random.randint(1,100)` will generate a number between 1 and 100
you can combine this with [[4. Data Structures 2#List Comprehensions]]
```python
[random.randint(1,100) for i in range(5)]
```
in order to generate a list of 5 random numbers between 1 and 100

##### Range
you can use `random.randrange(start,stop,step)`

### Seed
We may want to "seed" the random number generator to a know initial state (why??)
- [[#Mersenne Twister Algorithm]] 
	- is deterministic, which means that Given the same seed, we produce the same pseudo-randomnumber sequence
	- if is omitted or None, system sources of randomness are used
		- if not available the current time is used (not very secure)

with the default random module you can use `random.seeed(seed)` in order to do this.

### Saving and Restoring Internal State
You are able to save and restore the internal state of the generator. Which allows you to reproduce the results of previous experiments. in order to do this you can use
- `random.getstate()`
- `random.setstate()`

#### Save to a file
the value returned by `random.getstate()` is a python object so it cant be natively converted to a string.
you can use the [pickle] module to convert it into a string
```python
import pickle
with open("state.dat", "wb") as f:
	pickle.dump(random.getstate(), f) #Write
	
	state = pickle.load(f)
	random.setstate(state) #Read	
```
