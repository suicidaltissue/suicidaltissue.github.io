### Generator Functions
```python
a = 4 # Multiplier
m = 100 # Modulus
c = 20 # Increment

def lcg(x):
    while True:
        x = ((a * x) + c) % m
        yield x

rng = lcg(4)


for i in range(20):
    x = next(rng)
    print(x)
```

### Random From A Sequence
```python
import random
socks = ['blue', 'red', 'black', 'blue', 'green', 'black', 'yellow']

sock = random.choice(socks)
```

### Random Sampling
`random.sample(list, k)` returns a list of `k` unqiue elements chosen from the given list. Elements can only appear once in a sample generated like this, it is known as sampling without replacement. if you want to allow elements to appear more than once you can use `random.choices(list, k)`

#### Shuffling a Sequence
You can use `random.shuffle(seq)` in order to shuffle a list of items for example a deck of cards

```python

```

### SystemRandom Number Generator
Some operating systems provide a random number generator, this can be accessed via the [SystemRandom]() it has the same functions as `random` but uses the SystemRandom API For Generation, however there are a few caveats
    -` seed()` has no effect
    - `getstate()` is not implemented
    - `setstate()` is not implemened
    - Slower than `random` module

This means that it is not reproducible and therefore is not the best for scientific experiments.


### Secrets - For Secure Random Numbers
You are able to use the [secrets]() module to generate secure random numbers, this can be used for passwords, authentication or token.

```python
import secrets
secrets.randbelow(5) # Returns an integer in the range of [0,5]
secerts.choice(seq) # Returns a randomly chosen element
secrets.randbits(k) # Retrun an integer with k random bits
```

#### Generating Secure Tokens
lets say we need to generate a one time key for a password reset URL, you can use the `secrets.token_urlsafe()` in order to generate a random and url safe key

### NumPy
you can use `numpy.random` module when working with random numbers in NumPy. lets have a look at generating a 2 x 3 Matrix with random numbers between 0-1

```python
import numpy as np
rng = np.random.default_rng(0,10)
array = rng.random((2,3)) # Array Shape as a touple
print(array)
```

in order to do generate numbers between 1-10 you can use

```python
array = rng.integers(low=0, high=10, size=6)
```

this will generate an array of 6 random integers

#### Seeding using [[#Secrets - For Secure Random Numbers|Secrets]]

```python
seed = secrets.randbits(128)
rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)
```

#### Shuffle In Place
```python
x = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
rng.shuffle(x)
```

#### Permutation (Make A Copy)

```python
x = np.array[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
y = rng.permutation(x)
```


If you give permutation a single integer argument, it will make a shuffled range 
```python

```

this means we can use this to reorder 2 or more lists
```python

```
