# Descriptive Statistics
Is the idea of summarising and describing datasets.

## Measures of central tendency
What is an average or typical value for your data set? They tend to be 
- Mean (Sum of all the values divided by how many)
- Median (The Middle value after items are sorted)
	- could be the mean of two middle values if you have an even number of values
- Mode (The Most Frequently Occurring Value)

lets look at the following example of tree heights

```python
tree_heights = [13 ,17 ,20 ,20 ,22 ,23 ,18 ,18 ,14 ,15 ,17 ,14 ,10 ,10 ,14 ,15 ,16 ,16 ,14 ,14 ,14 ,12 ,14 ,13 ,19 ,18 ,27 ,24 ,20 ,19 ,20 ,20 ,20 ,20 ,20 ,20 ,20 ,22 ,19 ,20 ,19 ,18 ,18 ,19 ,21 ,19 ,10 ,22 ,22 ,10 ,19 ,22 ,15 ,18 ,19 ,15 ,17 ,13 ,21]
```

- Mean is 17.6
	- You  will notice that this number is not actually found in the dataset
- Median is 18
- Mode is 20
	- lets say the council wanted to find a cherry picker to prune all these trees
		- they may look at the maximum height however if this is not viable the mode would be a good second choice as majority of the trees will be of this height


you can calculate these using the [statistics] library, this is the most basic library that can provide statistics on [[3. Data Structures#Lists|Lists]]

```python
statistis.mean(x)
statistics.median(x)
statistics.mode(x)
```

the data could also be [multimodal] which is where the data has multiple values that both occur the most 
```python
statistics.multimode(X)
```

## Percentiles
Percentiles are a generalisation of the concept of the median
there are five commonly used percentiles
1. Minimum Value (0th)
2. First Quartile (25th)
3. Median (50th)
4. Third Quartile (75th) 
5. Maximum Value (100th)


## Quantiles
Percentiles will divide your data into 100 groups, quantiles will divide your data into **n** groups

```python
statistics.quantiles(tree_heights. n=4)
```

## Measures of dispersion
How far does the data vary from the average? are they widely scattered or are they the most typical, there 5 types of dispersion which we will go into detail on here.
### Range and interquartile range
Range: `highest - lowest`
Inter Quantile Range: 

Often Reported along with the median of data.

### Variance
Variance: average of the squared deviations (differences) from themean
Is used to figure out 

```python
mu = statistics.mean(X)
squared_diffs = [(x - mo) ** 2 for x in X]
var = statistics.mean(squared_diffs)
```

Instead of doing it with our own maths like shown above use `statistics.variance(tree_heights)`

#### sample or population?
There are two different types of variance that can be used
````col
```col-md
flexGrow=1
===
**Population**

```
```col-md
flexGrow=1
===
**Sample**
![[Pasted image 20240419214200.png]]
```
````
```python
print(f ' pop var: { statistics . pvariance ( tree_heights )} ' )
print(f ' samp var: { statistics . variance ( tree_heights )} ' )
```


#### Why n-1 when calculating variance of a sample?
[Bessel's Correction]
The mean of your sample is biased to be more representative ofthe sample rather than the wider population.


### Standard deviation
Is the square root of variance, it is used to determine how far on average the points vary from the mean.

Why? because the variance is the mean of the square of the differences.
### Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)

```python
tree_heights_array = np.array( tree_heights , dtype=np.int32)
print(f ' median :{ np. median ( tree_heights_array )} ' )
print(f ' MAD :{ stats . median_abs_deviation ( tree_heights_array )} ' )
```

## Measures of central tendency and dispersion?
- **Mean:** Represents all the data, including the outlier
- **Median:** is the most middle one (or average of the most middle two)
- **Mode:** is the most frequent

Considering the different measures of central tendency that are available, which one is best for the following statistics
-  **Average salary in the UK:** 
- **Comparing Exam Results With Last Years:** 
- **Which Age Is Typical for an insurance claim:** 

## Using measures of central tendency for outlier detection
We want to know what’s typically expected. Sometimes we want to know what’s unexpected: anomalies, threats, problems, changes, outliers


## Normal Distribution
- 1 standard deviation from mean captures 68.2% of the data
- 2 standard deviations from mean captures 95.4% of the data
- 3 standard deviations from mean captures 99.7% of the data
