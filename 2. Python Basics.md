# Operators

| Precedence | Type                   | Operator                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1          | Parentheses (grouping) | ()                       |
| 2          | Exponentiation         | **                       |
| 3          | Multiplicative         | *, /, //, %              |
| 4          | Additive               | +, -                     |
| 5          | Comparisons            | <, <=, >, >=, <>, !=, == |
| 6          | Logical NOT            | not                      | 
| 7          | Logical AND            | and                         |
| 8          | Logical OR             | or                         |

# Variables

In Python, the values have types. So 3.4 is a float, and "hello" is a string.
The variable is just a name for a value. You could think of it as a pointer to that box in memory that holds the value.
Later in the code, that same variable might refer to another value of a differenttype entirely

## Identifiers
● Alphabetic or underscore, followed by alphanumeric or underscore
● Can’t start with a number (e.g., not 2night)
● use_underscores
● use_lower_case
● snake_case — notCamelCase

## Variable Unpacking
In python you are able to assign multiple values to multiple variables with just one line.

```python
x, y = 5, 10;
```

# Dynamic Typing

# User Input
There is a built in function `input()` which takes a prompt as its argument and then displays that to the user. It will then get a line of input from the user and return that as a String

```python
name = input("Enter Your Name: ");
print("Hello " + name + " Good Afternnon");
```

# Conditionals
| Type | Function                 |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| ==   | Equals                   |
| !=   | Not Equals               |
|      | Less Than                |
|      | Greater Than             |
|      | Less Than Or Equal To    |
|      | Greater Than Or Equal To |
|      |                          |
|      |                          |

## IF Statements
```python
if temp < 10:
	print("Less Than 10 Degrees, its cold")
else:
	print("Nice and warm")
```


## Combining Conditionals

## Truthy and Falsie
The following values evaluate to False.
- None
- False
- Zero Of Any Numeric Type
	- 0
	- 0.0 
- Empty Sequences And Collections
	- ""
	- ()
	- []
	- {}
	- set()
	- range(0)

# Loops
There are a number of different loops available in python and each has different use cases.
## While
Use a while loop when:
- The Number Of Iterations is not defined
- The Loop can be exited based on a condition

```python
while x < 100:
	print("The Number is: ", x)
	x++
```

## Break
the `break` keyword can be used within a loop to stop the loop, this can be useful if you need to exit the loop early.

```python
while x < 100:
	print("The Number is: ", x)
	x++
	if(x > 20):
		break; # Finish The Whole Look
```

## Continue

```python
while x < 100: #End up here after continue
	print("The Number is: ", x)
	x++
	if(x > 20):
		continue; 
```

## Range
range(start, stop, step) is a function that will generate all the integers from start (default 0) to stop, but not including stop, and jumping by the optional step if it is provided.

```python
list(range(0,5)) # [0,1,2,3,4,5]
```

## For
```python
for x in range(2, 8):
	print("The Number is: ", x);
```
