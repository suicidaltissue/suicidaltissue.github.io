# Hypothesis Testing
Statistical hypothesis tests are based on a statement called the [[null hypothesis]], in short this assumes that there is nothing interesting going on between whatever variables you are testing. 
For example if you have a sample of data which summarises all purchases of tobacco in London the null hypothesis assumes that there is no relative difference from that number to the global average. 
We can do this in python using the [scipy.stats] library 

# Bat Weights
So for an example dataset to demonstrate hypothesis testing we will generate two datasets of male and female bat populations.
```python
size = 1000;
scale = 0.39;
female_bats = stats.norm.rvs(loc=5.54, scale=scale, size=size)
male_bots = stats.norm.rvs(loc=4.70, scale=scale, size=size)
```

we can then calculate the overall population by concatenating the two lists and then by using `.mean()` we can get the overall average mean
```python
overall_population = np.concatenate((female_bats, male_bats))
average = overall_population.mean();
```

````col
```col-md
flexGrow=1

```
```col-md
flexGrow=1
===
![[Pasted image 20240408102056.png]]
```
````

you can then plot that with [[10. Plotting|matplotlib]] to produce the graphs above.

```python
colors = ['green', 'orange']
plt.hist([male_bats, female_bats], 30, histtype='bar', color=colors, label=["male","female"])
plt.legend()
plt.savefig("bat_pops.png",dpi=300)
plt.close()

plt.hist(sample_bats,bins=30, histtype='bar')
plt.savefig("sample_bat_pop.png",dpi=300)
plt.close()
```


# Central Limit Theorem
The distribution of many sample means (sampling distribution) will be normally distributed, 
true even if the underlying distribution of the different samples is not normalised
this means that if you go out and take a large amount of samples, and record the means for these samples
these means will become normally distributed.


So lets say we go out one night and we sample 50 bats, for different sampling methods please read [[25. Sampling and Monte Carlo]] in this case we will use `rng.choice`

```python
sample_bats = rng.choice ( overall_population , size =50)
difference = overall_population.mean() - sample_bats.mean()
```

if we do this a large number of times then the distribution of the means of these samples will become more and more normal

# T Distribution
We take our sample mean and “studentise” it: normalise it with respect to sample mean and sample variance, which turns it into at-statistic
We then look at its position on the appropriate t-distribution to see how unusual it is
This process is called a t-test.

# Hypothesis Testing  
## Significance level and p-value

- The significance level is the probability threshold that determines when you should reject the null hypothesis
- The p-value is defined as the probability of obtaining a result equal to or "more extreme" than what was actually observed,if the null hypothesis is true
- If the p-value is lower than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative

# T-Test
Is a statistical test used to determine significant differences in numerical data, this is done by comparing the mean.

## One Sample T-Test
`scipy.stats.ttest_1samp(a, popmean)`
Does the mean of the numeric data sample differ significantly from the population mean?

### Example
Take a sample of 50 bats from the female population

**Null Hypothesis:** There is no difference between the average bat weights in our Aber sample and the nation average
**Alternative Hypothesis:** there is a significant difference between the average bat weight in Aber compared with the national average

```python
sample_bats = rng.choice(overall_population, size=50)
```

we then need to compare the weights of this sample to the weights of the overall population. are they significantly different? 

```python
t_test = stats.ttest_1samp(sample_bats, overall_population.mean())
```

We accept or reject based on the [[#Significance level and p-value|P Value]] in this case the result was `(statistic=-0.28439, pvalue=0.77731)` 
since the P-Value was above the significance level of 5% or 0.05 we cant reject the null hypothesis 
which means that the alternative hypothesis is correct and there is no significant difference 

## Two-Sample T-Test
`stats.ttest_ind(a, b)` calculates the t-test for the means of two independent samples
do the means of two numeric data samples differ significantly from each other? 

### Example
For example, does the average weight of a sample of bats from Aber differ from the average weight of bats sampled in Swansea?
**Null Hypothesis:** There is no significant difference between bat  weights in Aberystwyth and those in Swansea
**Alternative Hypothesis:** There is a significant difference between the groups

```python
aber_bats = stats.norm.rvs(loc=5.10 , scale=0.33 , size=30)
swansea_bats = stats.norm.rvs(loc=5.25 , scale=0.34 , size=30)
two_test = stats.ttest_ind(a=aber_bats , b=swansea_bats)
```

## Paired T-Test
`stats.ttest_rel(a=before , b=after)`
The two sample paired t-test is designed for testing differences between samples of the same group at different points in time

### Example
a hospital wants to test whether a weight-loss drug works by checking the weights of the same group of patients before and after treatment
**Null hypothesis:** There is no difference before and after treatment
**Alternative hypothesis:** There is a significant difference before and after treatment

```python
before = stats.norm.rvs(scale =30, loc =250, size=100)
after = before + stats.norm.rvs(scale=5, loc=-1.25, size=100)
test = stats.ttest_rel(a=before , b=after)
```

# Two-sided and One-Sided Tests
The tests we have used so far are two-sided tests: The alternative hypothesis is that the means of the two samples differ significantly, and we don’t care how they differ.
Sometimes, we do want to test whether the mean of one sample is greater than or less than the other. The tests we have used have an optional keyword parameter alternative that can be used to perform a one-sided test (from scipy v1.6.0)

- `alternative="less"` tests the hypothesis that the mean of  the first sample (a) is less than the mean of the second sample (b)
-  `alternative="greater"` tests the hypothesis that the mean of the first sample (a) is greater than the mean of the second sample (b)
- `alternative="two-sided"` is the default, and tests the hypothesis that the means of the two samples a and b differ
