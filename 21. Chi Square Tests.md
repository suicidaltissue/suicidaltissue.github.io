# Chi Square Test
Test for categorical data, goodness of fit and independence, it is one of the most frequently used data tests in the world. It was developed by a guy who worked at guiness and is still talked about to this day because it is so well used it checks weather the frequencies of categories in our sample data are a good fit for the frequencies in the general population, some examples of this could be.
- Test Whether the computer browser preferences of your friends match those of internet users as a whole
- Test Whether the relative numbers of different fish species are affected by warm water outflow from a nuclear power station
- Test Whether there are more people claiming "Jedi" as their religion in a university town compared to the general population

`stats.chisquare(f__obs, f_exp)` tests that the categorical data has the expected frequencies
- **f_obs** Observed Frequencies in each category
- **f_exp** Expected Frequencies in each category

## Categorical Data
When working with categorical data, the values of the observations themselves aren't of much use for statistical testing.
this is because categories such as "trout", "carp" or "flounder" have no mathematical meaning
instead tests dealing with categorical data are based on variable counts or frequencies instead of the actual values of the variables.

## Example 1: Star-fleet Cadets
![alt text](image.png)
Does the species demographics of Star-fleet Academy match that of the entire Federation

**Null Hypothesis:** There is no significant difference between distribution of species in Star-fleet Academy compared to the general population

**Alternative Hypothesis:** There is a significant difference between them

### Species Data

![[Pasted image 20240507093924.png]]

### Process
1. Set the null hypothesis
	1. Starfleet Academy Frequencies match federation frequencies
2. Read data From the CSV File
3. Barplot the data
4. Work out the expected frequencies of the data
5. Set significance level = 0.05
6. Conduct a chi square test
7. if P-Value is less than 5% we reject the null hypothesis

### Reading The Data
We will read the data into a [[11. Pandas#Data Frames]] 
```python
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib . pyplot as plt
filename = 'st_species.csv'

df = pd.read_csv(filename, index_col='Species')
df.plot(kind='bar', rot=0)
```
for more information on this see [[11. Pandas#Reading a data file]]

#### Compute Expected Frequencies
because the star-fleet academy data is at such a smaller scale than the whole fedation we must normalise the data, this is done by scaling (normalising) the federation data to be the same scale as the star-fleet data, to do this we
- Take each column of the sample
- Divide value by the total
- This gives us the fraction for each column
- multiply this by the size of the star-fleet data

```python
def normalise_freq(data, size):
	normalised_data = data/data.sum() * size
	return normalised_data

norm_df = df.copy()
sample_size = norm_df['StarFleet'].sum()
norm_df['Federation'] = normalise_freq(norm_df['Federation'], sample_size)
norm.df.plot(kind='bar', rot=0)
```

### Observed & Expected Frequencies

```

```
````

### Computing the Chi-square test
```python
observed = norm_df['Starfleet']
expected = norm_df['Federation']

result = stats.chisquare(f_obs=observed, f_exp=expected)
```

### Chi-square result
The result of the Chi-Square test is similar to the result from a T-Test.
```
Power_divergenceResult(
statistic=18.194805194805177,
pvalue=0.0011304670928034746
)
```
it contains a Probability Value (P-Value) which tells you how similar the the two inputs are, usually you then reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis depending on this value. In this case the value is less than 0.05 so we reject the null hypothesis

## Important! Must satisfy frequency requirements!
- The Chi-Square test is invalid when the expected frequencies in each category are too small.
	- A Typical rule of thumb is that >80% of the expected frequncies should be atleast 5
- if you data doesn't meet these requirements you could try
	- Collecting more data
	- Combine some categories
	- Use a different statistical test
		- Fisher's Exact Test

## Independence
Independence is a key concept in probability theory. We say that two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other.

it describes a situation where knowing the value of one variable (event) tells you nothing about the value of the other
- For Example the month you where born probably doesn't tell you anything about which web browser you use
	- This means that birth month and browser preference are independent 
- On the other hand, robbing a bank and going to prison are likely to be dependant events

### Chi-square test of independence
is used to test whether two categorical variables are idependant or not.
this is used in social sciences for determining whether variables like education, political views or other preferences vary based on demographic factors like gender, religion or ethnic group.

#### Example
We are going to use it to test whether a vaccination trial had an effect on health outcomes (are the health outcomes of participants independent of vaccination or not?) to do this we have data from two groups of 92

- **Group 1:**  Not provided with the vaccination
- **Group 2:**  Provided with the vaccine

Each group has 3 health outcomes measured after a 3 month period
- Sick with Covid-19
- Sick with another corona virus
- Not Sick At All

##### Data

| Health Outcome      | Unvaccinated | Vaccinated |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Sick With Covid19   | 23           | 5          |
| Sick With Different | 8            | 10         |
| Not Sick At All     | 61           | 77         |
data provided in this format is called a contingency table, this is the table of observed frequencies of each of the categories. 

##### Running The Test

```python

```
