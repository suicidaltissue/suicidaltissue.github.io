# Sampling

## Replacement
**Without Replacement:** Each element can only be added once to the sample

**With Replacement:** Duplicates can appear in the sample, each time we select a item for the sample we assume that all are still available.

## Functions
- `random.sample()`
- `random.choices()`
- `numpy.random.Generator.choice()`
- `pandas.DataFrame.sample()`

### Random Library
```python
socks = []
print(random.sample(socks, k=5))
```

### Numpy
```python
likes_coriander = [1,0,1,1,1,0]
rng = np.random.default_rng()
print(rng.choice(likes_coriander, size=5, replace=False))
```

### Pandas
```python
data = pd.read_csv("campusrooms.csv")
print(data.sample(n=4, replace=False))
```

# Monte Carlo
- Given a probability distribution
- Repeatedly take a pseudo-random sample from it
- Calculate something of interest for each sample
- Aggregate the results

## Example: Approximating Pi
Lets Sample The Points (from the uniform distribution) to determine how many are inside or outside the circle

### Try It
```python
num_points = 1000
num_in_circle = 0

for i in range(num_points):
	x = random.uniform(-1,1)
	y = random.uniform(-1,1)

	if x**2 + y**" <= 1:
		num_in_cirlce += 1

pi = 4 * num_in_circle / num_points
```

## Example: Blind Bag Collecting
- Lets say we are parents and our kid wants to collect all the ponies in the "My Little Pony: Friendship and Magic" Blind Bags, there are 12 to collect in total.
- Lets say the items are uniformly uniformly distributed
- What if they have unequal probabilities?

Lets say we have ponies A -> L, each has a difference frequency (chance of appearing in a bag) how many bags do we expect to buy in order to collect the whole set?

### Distribution

```python
how_many = []
for i in range(10000):
	number = collect_all_ponies()
	how_many.append(number)

plt.hist(how_many, bins=100)
```

### Descriptive Statistics
```python
print("mean", np.mean(how_many))
print("median", np.median(how_many))
print("min", min(how_many))
print("max", max(how_many))
```

### List Comprehension
You can then use a list comprehension to combine these into a singular list
```python
[ collect_all_ponies() for i in range(10000) ]
```
