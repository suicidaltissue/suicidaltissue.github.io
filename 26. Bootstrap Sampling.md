# Bootstrap Sampling
Technique using repeated sampling from a sample to calculate a statistic.
In this case calculating a statistic directly from a sample without referring to stats table or known distributions

- If we take a sample from a population he statistics of the sample, would usually not be exactly the same as the statistics of the whole
- Each time we take a sample there is a bit of variation
- When we only have one sample we don't know the full distribution or population, we can get a feeling for the variation that may exist by sampling from our sample. This is bootstrapping
## Process
- Treat the sample as if it were a whole population
- Draw multiple samples from the sample, each of size **n** the same size as the original
	- This is done **with replacement**
	- This means any particular element might appear more than once 
- Use the samples to get a good idea of what you want to measure
	- This could be a T-Test
	- Comparing Means
	- or any other statistic.

## Bumpus and house sparrows
Hermon Bumpus measured sparrows rescued after a storm in 1898, He wrote a paper that provided his measurements in summary "Seventy-two of these birds revived; Sixty-four perished" in `bumpus.csv` you can see this collected data. we are going to run a t-test on this data to determine weather there is any correlation between a sparrows weight and survival

### Did the lighter sparrows survive better?
As we are asking a statistical question we need to set out a Null Hypothesis and a Alternative Hypothesis

**Null Hypothesis:**  Surviving sparrows are not lighter than dead sparrows
**Alternative Hypothesis:** Surviving sparrows are lighter than dead ones

#### Dataset
We have a CSV Data file, containing this information how would we run a T-Test on it
```csv
(see file bumpus.csv on Lecture 26 (week 9), csv file is insanely long)
```

#### Which T-Test Function to use
- `stats.ttest_1samp`
- `stats.ttest_ind`
- `stats.ttest_rel`

```python
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats

data = pd.read_csv("bumpus.csv")
dead = data[data["survival"] == "F"]
alive = data[data["survival"] == "T"]

result = stats.ttest_ind(alive["weight (g)"],
						dead["weight (g)"],
						alternative="less")
#print the p-value to 4 decimal places
print("t-test pvalue:", round(result.pvalue, 4))
```

#### What's the Result?
The t-test function considers the differences in means:
```python
real_difference = alive["weight (g)"].mean() - dead["weight (g)"].mean()
```

Real difference is negative, -0.6345486111111143
The t-test p-value: 0.0059

This can say that the difference is significant (p-value is less than a threshold of 5% or 0.05), so we reject the null hypothesis, and we can say that surviving sparrows are significantly lighter than sparrows that died.
#### Doing the same by bootstrap

```python
M:/Year 2 Modules/Scipy/bootstrap.py
```

##### Sampling Code
```python
num_alive = len(alive)
num_dead = len(dead)
num_bootstraps = 50000

diffs = []

for i in range(num_bootstraps):
	sample_alive = data.sample(n=num_alive, replace=True)
	sample_dead = data.sample(n=num_dead, replace=True)
	weights_asamp = sample_alive["weight (g)"]
	weights_dsamp = sample_dead["weight (g)"]
	diffs.append(weights.asamp.mean() - weights.dsamp.mean())
	
```

##### Histogram
![[Pasted image 20240510112145.png]]
Red line is our real value

```python
plt.hist(diffs, bins=20)
plt.axvline(real_difference, color="red")
```

Is it in the bottom 5% of the possible values?
```python
sorted_diffs = sorted(diffs)

loc = np.searchsorted(sorted_diffs, real_difference)
#print(sorted_diffs[:3]) #check this looks as expected

print("sampling p-value:", loc/num_bootstraps)
```

### How many samples do we need?
- Depends on how many things:
	- How large your difference is
	- How large your data is
- If we are hoping for a p-value of < 0.05 could we use 10 samples?
- Use at least 1000, Ideally much more
- NEVER RUN IT MULTIPLE TIMES TO PICK THE BEST P-VALUE

## Bootstrap is flexible
- The T-Test tests the difference in means
- With bootstrap sampling we can look at other statistics that we don't have a test or distribution for, or for which the T-Test assumptions don't hold
	- Difference In Medians
