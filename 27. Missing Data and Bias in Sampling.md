# Representing Missing Data
- **None** - Python Keyword representing "No Value", not the same as 0 or False
- **Numpy.nan** - Not A Number
- **Pandas.nat** - Not a Time
- **Pandas.na** - Not Available (Warning: New And Experimental)

# Handling Missing Data
- Drop Rows: `pd.DataFrame.dropna(axis=0)`
- Drop Columns: `pd.DataFrame.dropna(axis=1)`
- Fill in the missing values with mean / media / mode or a given value
	- `pd.DataFrame.fillna(value=x.mean())`
- Impute Values 
- Use methods that have their own ways to deal with missing values
- Collect Better Data

## Try it
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

scores = pd.DataFrame([
    [np.nan, 1, 2],
    [1, 2, np.nan],
    [1,2,3]
])
```

- `scores.dropna()` - 
	- `axis=0` - 
	- `axis=1` - 
- `scores.fillna(0)` - 
- 

# What if the CSV file has some other representation of missing data?
Lets look at this example csv file
```csv

```

when using pandas `read_csv` it will read these as NaN, those columns become floats instead of ints

## What about something more unusual?
What if your data containts `"***"` for missing values? All you have to do is set the `na_values` parameters to a List containing all the null values in your dataset
```python
example = pd.read_csv("example_star.csv", na_values=["***"])
```

## Replacing Other Annotations
What if your data contains annotations to the data, this could be
- Cell Background Colours
- Extra Characters

### Regular Expressions
You can use regular expressions to replace a ? at the end of the value with an empty string, you can do it without regex for something this simple however regex is a lot more flexible and allows you to match and replace more complex annotations

```python

```

You can find a list of regexp for excel annotations [here]()

## Fixing the types
After replacing values you may need to convert the column type to a suitable type
looking at the example above after removing the ? fromt the shoe size column you will want to convert it to a number
```python
fixed["shoe size"] = pd.to_numeric(fixed["shoe_size"])
```

# Types of missing data
Very Poor Names For Historical Reasons

## Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
- Cause of the missing data is completely random and not predictable
- Reason for the data being missing is unrelated to the study
- No link between the missingness and other data you've collected or would collect
## Missing at Random
- Not really at random but cause is systematic and inferrable
	- This means there is a reason for it
- Missing data can be inferred from other known data
- For example: on a weather station measuring sun, wind. rain and humidity, very high wind speeds cause the humidity sensor to disconnect
	- 

## Missing Not At Random
- The missingness pattern depends on the values of unobserved variables and is important to your study

# Filling in with the mean value
We could fill in missing values with the mean value, however this has consequences. 

````col
```col-md
flexGrow=1
===
## Before

```
```col-md
flexGrow=1
===
## After
```
````

as you can see there is a large chunk that doesn't look like it matches the same distribution of the other data.

# Data Missing Because Of Sampling Bias
Sampling bias occurs when a sample is collected in such a way that some of the members of the intended population have a lower or higher sampling probability than others.

## Examples
- **Self Selection Bias:** Students who fill in the module surveys are the students who attend class, therefore we don't get data from the ones who don't attend 
- **Exclusion Bias:** 
	- Students who moved to aber in September may not be registered to vote in this country for the autumn election
	- A Museum in an old building with steps might never get views of wheelchair users
- **Selection from a specific area:** Interviews done by news reporters on a weekday in a shopping centre are less likely to include people who work 9-5
- **Healthy User Bias:** People who enroll in health studies are often interested in health and are generally healthier than the general population
