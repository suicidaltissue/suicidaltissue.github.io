# Introduction
PCOT is a toolkit created for the EXOMars Rover, 

# Modules and Packages

## Modules
- Module is a singular python file that contains code
- Modules can be imported into other files so they can use the functions, variables and classes defined in it
- When importing a file that file is run, in order to prevent this you can use `if __name__ == "__main__`

## Packages

- A Package is a collection of modules or packages
- It's a directory containing a `__init__.py` file, which is run whenever the package or any subpackage is imported

## Importing
| Statement                      | Description |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| import mymod                   |             |
| import mypackage               |             |
| from mymod import x            |             |
| from mypack.mymod import x,y,z |             |
| from mymod import *            |             |

# Coupling and Cohesion
All entities in code weather functions, modules, packages should all follow these rules

- **Tight cohesion:** has a single purpose
- 

# Object Oriented Programming

# Controlling Dependencies

## Cyclic Imports

### Solutions
- Refactor Your Code
- Move The Import into the function that requires it

## Tooling with Poetry and Conda


# Project Structure

# Type Hints


# Tests
- Write unit tests in the tests package
- They can then be run by using `pytest` command in the project directory
