# Lists
A List in python is equivalent to a dynamic array in other languages, it allows you to store a number of different data types.
## Creating
```python
list_a = [1,2,3,'4']
```

## Adding / Removing

### Add Item(s)
```python
list_a.append("test")
```

### Update Item

```python
list_a[index] = "YOLO"
```

### Remove Item(s)

```python
x.pop(0) #Removes First Item (at index 0)
x.pop() #Removes Last Item
x.clear() #Removes All Items
x.remove("YOLO") #Removes Specific Value
```

## Accessing
A list element can be accessed using an index (both positive and negative).
List elements are counted from position 0.

```python
list_a[0] #Will return first item
list_a[len(list_a)] #Will return the last item
```

### Joining Lists
Joining lists together can be done with the `+` operator.

```python
a = [1,2,3]
b = [4,5,6]
c = a + b
```

### Slicing Lists
Slicing Lists allows you to generate a subset of a list without using a [[2. Python Basics#Loops|Loop]]
in order to do this you simply pass 2-3 elements between the `[]` when accessing a list

```python
x[start:end:step]
```

### Looping Over a List

```python
for element in my_list:
	print(element)
```


## Operations
There are a number of different methods that you can execute on a list to manipulate its contents
```python
sorted_list = sorted(list) # Returns a new sorted array
list.sort() # Sorts list and saves to original array

reversed_list = reversed(list)
list.reverse() # Reverese the list
```

# Tuples
A tuple is a finite sequence of ordered and indexed collections of objects.
### Creating

```python
tp = ("yolo", 1, 2)
```

tuples can also contain any other data structure including [[lists]] or other tuples.
```python

```

### Handling Tuples
Just like lists tuples can be index or sliced and their elements counted.

```python
bob = ("Bob", "Builer", 25)
bob[0] # Returns: "Bob"
bob[1:3] # Returns ("Builder", 25)
len(bob) # Returns 3
```

### Looping Over a Tuple
You can loop other a tuple using the same syntax as you would for a list.

```python
for x in students:
	print(x)
```

## Updating
Although you cannot change items in a touple, if you have mutable elements inside of it they can be updated.

```python
bob=("Bob", "Builer", ["bob@builder.com", "078677545232"])
bob[2][0] = "newemail@bob.com"
```

### Packing / Unpacking

```python
bobb = "Bob", "Builer", 25
bob = ("Bob", "Builder", 25)
```

```python
first_name, last_name, age = bob;
```
