# Sets
A set is like a list but contains no duplicates, they are defined by using `{}`
## Creating

```python
odds = {1, 4, 6}
odds = set(range(0,10))
```

## Adding / Removing

```python
odds.add(8) #Add Singular Item
odds.update(8,12) #Add Multiple Items
odds.update({3, 8}) #Add Items From Another Set
```

## Accessing
Because items in a set aren't ordered they cannot be index like an array with `odds[0]` even though they cant be indexed they can be iterated on

```python
for odd in odds:
	print(odd)
```

## Membership and Cardinality of sets
```python
if 8 in odds:
	print("8 is in the odds set")
```

```python
len(odds) #Get the legth of a set
```

## Equality
Because sets have no indexes the equivalence is based on weather they contain the same elements

```python
{1,2,3} == {3,2,1} # Returns True
{1,2,3} == {3,2,1,4} # Returns False
```

## Operations
### Union
```python
union = a | b
```

### Intersection
Members that appear in both a and b
```python
both = a & b
```

### Difference
```python
dif = a - b
```

### Symmetric Difference
```python
symdiff = a ^ b
```

## Use Cases

# Dictionaries
A dictionary is a data structure where you can store mappings between keys and values.
Otherwise known as an associative array or mapping in other languages.

## Creating

```python
phonebook = {}
phonebook = dict()
```

## Adding / Removing

```python
phonebook['harry'] = 999
```

```python
del phonebook['harry']
```

## Accessing
```python
harrysnumber = phonebook['harry']
```

you can also use the `in` operator to check if a key is present.
```python

```

or you can use the `get()` method to get the value of a specific key
```python

```

As well as this you can get the items or keys on their own without the mapping
```python
phonebook.keys() # Returns ['harry']
phonebook.items() # Returns 999
```

# Comprehension
Comprehension allows you to generate a list that would normally be generated with the use of a loop with one line of code.

## List Comprehensions
```python
squares = []
for i in range(20):
	squares.append(x**2)
```
can be simplified to
```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(20)]
```
this can be done with Lists or Sets and it provides a more computationally efficient and syntactically pretty way to generate lists and sets 

### Applying a method
```python
towns = ["Aberystwyth", "Cardiff"]
uppercase_towns = [town.upper() for town in towns]
```

### Applying a expression
```python
y = 100
num_list = [13,19,23,29,20,22,15,24]
new_list = [x+y, for x in num_list]
```

### Set Comprehensions
They work in the same way as List Comprehensions
`{ expression-with-variable for variable in input-iterable-object }`

### Dictionary Comprehensions
Require slightly more syntax than a list or set comprehension as it uses key:value mapping.

```python
{  key_variable : value_variable for key_variable, value_variable in input-iterable-object}
```

A Working example of this would be as follows.

```python
age = {"alice": 34, "bob": 25, "jay": 56}
newages = { k : v+1 for k, v in age.items() }
```

We can also convert a list/tuple/set to a dictionary using dictionary comprehensions.

```python
names = ["Bob", "Jay", "Dan"]
marks = [6, 10, 5]
student_dict = { k : v for k,v in zip(names, marks) }
```
