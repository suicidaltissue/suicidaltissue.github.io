# Functions
A function allows you to create chunks of reusable code, this allows you to produce cleaner and more efficient code.

## Calling Functions
A Function can be called by using the following syntax

```python
my_function()
```

## Defining Functions
Functions can be defined in python by using the `def` keyword, followed by indentation of the appropriate code

```python
def my_function():
	print("Called My Function")

```

## Arguments / Parameters
Functions can take parameters which can then be used within the functions code.

```python
def greet_user(name):
	print("Hello", name)


greet_user("Marley") # Prints "Hello Marley"
```


### Keyword Arguments
Instead of using an arguments position to match a function parameter, we can use keywork arguments to pass the right value to the right parameter.
```python
def weather_message(temp, low=3, med=10):
	...
	return msg
```
this technique is used with functions that have many options most of which you would normally leave with their default values

### Variadic Arguments
Some functions may take a variable number of arguments, an example of this would be the [print]() function, we can do this with our own functions
```python
def whatargs(a, b, *args):
	print("other args:", args)
```

any extra arguments passed `whatsargs(10,12,56,78)` will be captured as a tuple `(56,78)`

#### Variadic Keyword Arguments
You can also use variadic arguments but with keywords.
```python
def whatargs(a, b, **args):
	print("other args:", args)
```
instead of returning a tuple it will return a dictionary with mappings based on the arguments provided.

### Unpacking
You can unpack a list or tuple into postional parameters using `*` or you can unpack a dictionary into keyword parameters with `**`
```python
args_list = [10,20,30]
args_dict = {"p1": 10, "p2": 20}
func(*args_list)
func(**args_dict)
```

### Functions as Arguments
functions in python are first class objects, this means we can assign them to variables, pass them around and call them however we wish. this means you can also pass functions into other functions as arguments.

```python
def isLong(text):
	return len(text) > 5

def checktext(text, checkfunc):
	result = checkfunc(text)
	return result

checktext("hello", isLong)
```

### Default Values

## Return Values
Functions are able to return a value which can be used by the code calling that function, for example you may want to have a function which doubles a number and then returns the value, this can be done like so

```python
def double(num):
	return num * 2
```

### Returning Multiple Values

```python
def example():
	a = 1+2
	b = 4+5
	return a, b
```

or you can return a [[dictionary]] of values
```python
def example():
	a = 1+2
	b = 4+5
	return {"a": a, "b": b}
```
