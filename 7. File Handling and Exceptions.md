# Text File Handling
```python
filename = "messages.txt"
handler = open(filename)
lines = handler.readlines()
handler.close()
```

## Opening Files
When opening a file there are 3 different modes to choose from
```python
f = open("foo.txt") # for reading (default)
f = open("foo.txt", "r") # for reading (default)
f = open("foo.txt", "w") # for writing (take care!)
f = open("foo.txt", "a") # for appending (take care!)
```

## Closing Files
After Reading a file it is important to close it this can be done with `f.close()` however this can often be forgotten
another approach ensures that the files is closed as soon as it has been read

```python
with open("messages.txt") as my_file: # my_file is a file handle object
	line = my_file.readline()# do some processing for the line
	print("The first line contains" , len(line), "characters")
```

This approach ensures that the file is closed and the resource is released even if there is an error or exception.

## Reading Files
There are a number of ways to read files in python, you can either read a singular line at a time or all at once.
regardless of which method used we are going to assume that the following examples are indented within

```python
with open("messages.txt") as file:
```

### Read Singular Lines
```python
line = my_file.readline()
print(line)
```

### Read Multiple Lines
```python
all_lines = file.readlines()
for line in all_lines:
	print(line)
```

The `readlines()` functions returns a list of all the lines, you can then process them by iterating over them in the for loop, it is recommended to omit the variable declaration as this takes up unnessacary memory and instead use

```python
for line in file:
	print(line)
```

you can then use [`next()`](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/next) to ask for the next line or you can also use the `break` keywork to stop the loop.

## Writing Files
```python
with open("names.txt" ,"w") as my_file:
	my_file.writelines(data)
```

# CSV File Handling
CSV Files can be useful for storing any data you may generate or calculate. They provide a universal format that allows you to easily import the data anywhere before we actually do anything we any files we need to import the csv module

```python
import csv
filename = "planets.csv"
```

## Reading
we can then use the same syntax as before to open a reader for the csv file
```python
with open(filename, newline="") as csv_file:
	planet_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
	next(planet_reader) # Throws away header object
	for row in planet_reader:
		print(row[1])
```

## Writing
```python
header = [["first_name", "last_name", "mark"]]
data = ["Bob", "Builder", 25], ["Harry", "Potter", 15]
with open(filename, "w", newline="") as csv_file:
	student_writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
	student_writer.writerows(data)
	student_writer.writerow(["Marley", "Plant", 100])
```

# Exceptions
- ImportError
- NameError
- SyntaxError
- IdentationError
- TypeError
- IndexError
- KeyError
- IOError
- FileNotFoundError

## Handling Exceptions
```python
try:
	some_code()
except SomeException:
	print("Exception Handled")
else:
	print("Only Executed If there are no exceptions")
finally:
	print("Do Final Thing Weather Exception Accured or not")
```
