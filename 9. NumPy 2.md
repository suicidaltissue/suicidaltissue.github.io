# Vectorised Operations
When performing operations on NumPy arrays, most of the time we do not use loops
Instead NumPy has a powerful feature called [vectorisation]() which performs operations on a vector (set of values)
all at once instead of one element at a time. This is done using pre-compiled low level functions.

# Scalar Operations
A Scalar operation is [element-wise](), this includes
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

You are able to use [[#Vectorised Operations]] to perform these opeartions which drastically increases effeciency

```python
import numpy as np# Converting Centigrade to Fahrenheit:
c_temps = np.array([15, 18, 23, 20])
f_temps = c_temps * 9/5 + 3
```

## Compared to [[2. Python Basics#Loops#For|FOR LOOPS]]
Whenever computational efficiency is important we should avoid using loops. 
On my git repository for this module I have included a [Script](https://gitlab.aber.ac.uk/map166/cs24520-excersizes/-/blob/master/NumPy/effeciency.py?ref_type=heads) which will test the efficiency
- Vecorised Operation - **0.04s**
- FOR IN - **3.66s**
- FOR IN RANGE - **3.72s** 

### Create An Array Of Other Numbers
```python
np.ones(5) * 3 #Returns array([3,3,3,3,3])
```

### Create an array based on other arrays
```python
b = np.ones(3, dtype="int")
np.array([b*5, b, b*8]) #Returns array([5,5,5], [1,1,1], [8,8,8])
```

### Modify Array
lets look at our b array, lets say we want to perform an operation on a slice of this array.

```python
b[1:2] = b ** 2
```

## Same Shape
```python
a = np.array([1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9])
b = np.ones((3,3), dtype=int) * 2
# You can then apply any of the following operations
x,y,z = a + b, a * b, a / b
```

## Different Shapes With Broadcasting
when doing arithmetic on arrays of different shapes, you need to be able to broadcast the smaller array to make up the required shape. This is shown in the diagram above, each list of operations will return the same result, broadcasting the various arrays together to form the final shape.

# Matrix multiplication
![[Pasted image 20240313175654.png]]
There are two different methods to perform matrix multiplication with NumPy
- `a * b` does element wise multiplication
- `a @ b`will perform matrix multiplication (python 3.5 onwards)

# NumPy Functions
NumPy offers a wide range of functions which allow efficient ways to work with numerical datasets

## Mathematical Functions
NumPy provides a number of element-wise functions such as
- `np.log(array)`
- `np.sin(array`
- `np.sqrt(array)`

for a full list of functions see [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.math.html)

## Sequential Functions
You can use sequential functions to operate on all elements of an array as a single sequence.
- `np.sum(x)`
- `np.min(x)`
- `np.max(x)`
- `np.mean(x)`

these functions can all be called as an array method by using `x.function()`

## Sorting Arrays
We are able to sort arrays across a specified axis independently.
For example in a 2D array we can sort elements accross rows or columns.

````col
```col-md
flexGrow=1
===
![[Pasted image 20240313135931.png]]
```
```col-md
flexGrow=3
===
```python
x = np.array([[5,4,6], [2,1,3]])

# Return a sorted copy
np.sort(x) # Sorts accross last axis
np.sort(x, axis=0)
np.sort(x, axis=1)

# or you can use x.sort(etc) to do this inplace
```
````
## Reshaping Arrays
You are able to reshape an array by either using `np.reshape(array, (width, height))` or `array.reshape(width,height)`

## More Useful Functions
- `np.unique(array)` finds unique elements in array
- `np.transpose(array)` converts rows to columns to columns to rows

# View or Copy?
you are able to check weather a variable is its own array or just a view by using
```python
np.shares_memory(ndarray1, ndarray2)
```

# Reading / Writing From Files
![[Pasted image 20240313133459.png]]

## Manipulating CSV Files
```python
# choose comma delimiters, skip a line of header, and use the 2nd and 3rd columns only
mydata = np.loadtxt("objects.csv", delimiter=",", skiprows=1, usecols=(1, 3))


# perform some array operations
mydata = mydata+100

# save modified data (two decimal point numbers) into a new file using comma delimiters
np.savetxt("objects_out.csv", mydata, delimiter=",", fmt="%.2f")
```
